### "MPG Preds" Shiny app: Files for the final course project. 
**MPG preds** is a Shiny application for the Course Project in the present course. It helps the users to build linear regression models that predict the MPG variable on the mtcars data. In this app, you can use the other variables in the mtcars data as predictors and then, select the regression parameters you want to see in the right side panel.

Here is the link of the app: https://sunsinner.shinyapps.io/MPG_preds/
If you want to look at the UI.R and SERVER.R files, they are in the *mpg_preds_shiny_app* zip. Feel free to review them. 

The file "app_presentation.html" contains a brief description of the Shiny app, while "app_presentation.rmd" holds the r markdown code. Download them if you want a close review. 

Have a nice day! :)
